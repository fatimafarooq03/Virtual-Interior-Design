## Project Overview:
Virtual Interior Design is a 3-D software, involving user interaction, to provide an environment for the creation and experimentation of Interior Design models.
Our post-pandemic world today needs interior designers and design thinkers more than ever. By spending more and more time in interior spaces, we are witnessing the direct connection between our environments and well-being. Hence, we must keep up with the advancing times and incorporate the use of technology in this field.
Traditional methods of advising and assisting customers have relied upon a combination of verbal explanations and 2D drawings, intuition, and the costly process of trial and error. While this has served the industry faithfully, it has principal flaws. The process of communicating can often leave a lot of room for confusion and disappointment.
This method also creates a lot of difficulty for the interior designer himself, as the investment in trial and error is not efficient. The amount of visualization required makes it very difficult to plan on a large scale.
Using VR for interior design produces staggering results. Instead of drawing, explaining, or imagining what a room may look like, people can now put on a VR device and walk through different iterations of their future living room. Due to the increasing cost-effectiveness of virtual visualizations, these sorts of virtual walkthroughs are becoming ever more common for both corporate and personal customers. In large part, this is because of increasing partnerships between software developers and interior designers to bring greater precision and affordability to virtual interior designs and hence the scope is growing and enormous.

## Project Objectives:
1. To provide a basic model for the users to see and experience 3D models
2. To allow user interaction to personalize their space from the options provided by the software
